    	<h1> Interneting Is Easy </h1>
        <p> First need to learn basic of HTML. </ps>
        	<h2> Headings</h2>
        	<p> Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings</p>
          <h2> Lists</h2>
          <p> This is how you make an Unordered list: </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Add a UL (It stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li> Add each elements in its own "li" element </li>
            <li> They dont need to be in any particular order</li>
          </ul>
          <p> This is how the Ordered ist looks like</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Notice the new "ol" wrapping everything</li>
            <li> But the list item elements are the same</li>
            <li> Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
            <li> You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
          </ol>
          <h2> Inline Element </h2>
          <p><em> Sometimes</em> If you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase </p>
          <p> Other times you need to <strong>Strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word phrase</p>
          <p> <em> <strong>And sometimes you need to shout</em> </strong></p>
